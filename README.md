# Urban_Greenery

This program were completed by Python, R, Google Earth Engine, and QGIS. Github only allows to upload files less than 25 MB, so the full codes were saved in Google Drive. The dataset was too large, so it was not included in Google Drive. 

Also, most of variables were calculated through Python and saved as csv and shapefiles (Google Drive), and the maps of variables were plotted through R.
